# Discord/Steam Verifier
The bot in [scarfybot.py](/scripts/discord_bot/scarfybot.py) listens for new people joining the discord server and stores their discord ID with a generated string key. If the player types `!verify <string_key>` in the Fistful of Frags server chat, it will store a combination of their steam ID and discord ID and give them the verified discord role.

I'll flesh this out later but I'm in a hurry, yell at me to finish this later.
